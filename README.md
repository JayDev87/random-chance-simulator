r1 = First number in chance
r2 = Second number in chance.
So r1 out of r2 chance. 1 is the number it will consider a win.
x = The amount of loops it will do (Simulations).
setting = The y/n for the configurable parameter of the text. Having this to no will allow the sim to run 10-20 times faster but having it on may be the best bet if you want to see the process of the system.
